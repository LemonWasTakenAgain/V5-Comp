# VRC Spinup Vex 5 Robotics Competition

  This project is the code for the upcoming October Vex 5 Competition.
  
  The Controls for the bot are as follows:
 
 - Left Analog = Movement Forward/Reverse
 - Right Analog = Steering
 - L1 Bumper Begin Endgame/Expansion
 - L2 Bumper Reverse Endgame/Expansion
 - R1 Bumper Begin Wall roller movement
 - R2 BUmper Reverse Wall roller movement
 
 The current obstacles of the project are testing if we have enough motor speed to launch the disks into the hoops.
 
 Upgrades:
- I can easily alter the controls for drivers most comfortable needs.
- More motors can also be easily configured and added to the launcher for greater speeds.
- Motors additionally added for speed with the robot however this is likely not needed as it is fast.
